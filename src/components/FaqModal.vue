              | Blockchain was developed with some core
              | central properties (decentralization, transparency, and immutability) 
              | that make it attractive for certain use cases. 
              | These properties enable and empower transparent and secure financial systems in addition
              | to several creative use cases that are not particularly main stream today.
              | By understanding and utilizing things like #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2") SHA-2 hashing]
              | and transparency and immutability within the blockchain, it's possible to store 
              | digital signatures of information/data in order to
              | at a later time come back and validate with certainty that this
              | information was in fact true and existed at a particular snapshot in time.
            p
              | Why would this be valuable or important? Think of legal cases when
              | you want to authenticate a video, audio, or document existed at a particular
              | point in time. If the digital hash of this file existed in the blockchain
              | at the time alleged and we can take the current file, calculate it's digital
              | signature now and compare it to the blockchain's stored signature, we can
              | confirm there has been no tampering of that file since then.
